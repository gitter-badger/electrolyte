## <a name="feature"></a> Want a Feature?
You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository.  
If you would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change 
it is:

* **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be 
discussed first with the core team so that we can better coordinate our efforts,
prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is
successfully accepted into the project.
* **Small Changes** can be crafted and submitted to the GitHub Repository as a
Pull Request.

## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue
Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already
answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  Providing the following
information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a stack trace helps
* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you
* **Version(s)** - is it a regression?
* **Reproduce the Error** - provide a working example set of steps to reproduce.
* **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point
to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)
